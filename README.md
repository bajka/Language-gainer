Final application have a little bit different ones but in summary they are almost the same.
In future there's idea to add MOBX to application to simplify a little bit data flow in app, add possibility to watch youtube podcast, add possibility to add new course(maybe in different language), change some views and improve UX side of application, move styles to different file, extract more component from code and add progress page.
